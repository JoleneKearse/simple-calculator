# simple-calculator

My very simple calculator app inspired by this [freeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-dom-build-a-calculator-app/#how-to-build-the-calculator-app).  This was a great article to brush up on DOM manipulation!  The ![end product](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/simple-calculator/blob/main/screenshots/article-result.png) looked like this, so I decided to add some glassmorphism styling!

The [background image](https://unsplash.com/photos/4CcZK19ViNM) by Mahdi Bafande inspired my color scheme.  The only exciting thing I did was adding a text stroke to the output to make it a little more readable.  Here is my code: ![-webkit-text-stroke: 1.5px black;
    -webkit-text-fill-color: #d2d2d2;](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/simple-calculator/blob/main/screenshots/code-text-stroke.png).

Here's my finished product: ![screenshot](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/simple-calculator/blob/main/screenshots/my_version.png).
